# About Me
I am in the Applied Statistics and Data Management Certificate Program at NC State. I decided to pursue the certificate to learn more about data management and analytics. I obtained by bachelors and MBA from East Carolina University and I currently work in the banking industry. 

## More Information

I am originally from Rowland, NC but moved to Raleigh for work shortly after graduating from ECU.  In my free time I enjoy reading, shopping, and traveling.  I look forward to doing more of these things in 2022 after completing the certificate program next spring.
