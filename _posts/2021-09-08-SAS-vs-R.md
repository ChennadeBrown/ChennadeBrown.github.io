## My Experience with SAS and R

I took ST 555 prior to this course so I have experience using SAS. R
seems more user friendly than SAS. For example, I have been able to
understand how to utilize functions in R by using the help function that
provides examples of code. I don’t recall there being a built in help
function in SAS. Although SAS has SAS documentation that users can
search on the web. SAS also seems more sensitive than R. I don’t get as
many errors or warning messages when using R as I did when I was using
SAS. I have also found that information on the web is readily available
to help R users resolve errors. When using SAS it was not as easy to
resolve errors. So I really like the help function in R and the
availability of help that is available on the web for R users.There
aren’t a lot of things I miss about SAS; however, I was impressed with
how quickly SAS could process large amounts of data. Also SAS syntax was
not too difficult to learn. I have been able to do the homework
assignments thus far so I don’t feel that R is a difficult language to
learn; however, R language is different from SAS syntax.
